-> tag and switch window manager

original idea
-> rno, texane

why another window manager
-> I mostly use graphical applications that dont need to share the screen surface
-> I dont use the mouse, only keyboard
-> I dont have much opened application, so I can remember their name, or tags
-> I want a fast way to switch inbetween applications
-> I dont want the window manager to spend computing resources to impelment software
abstractions I dont use: keyboard shortcuts, tiling algorithms, client application stacks...

minimal set of features:
-> create a client
-> tag a client with an expression
-> switch on a client matching a given tag
